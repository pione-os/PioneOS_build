clean-script-output
    Use sed to strip out extra carriage-returns (\r)at the end of
    lines and strip out text preceding carriage-returns that are
    not at the end of the line.  This cleans out very long lines
    that can get created when programs use use \r repeatedly to
    overwrite the last line written.

    packages in flavour lists into COMMON and base-AND-full
    lists.

    the installed WMs. We use a local copy if it exists.  This

    sure any skip_part call jives with the previous do_part
